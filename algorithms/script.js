//1. Remove Adjacent Duplicates From a String (currently only works if string is only composed of adjacent duplicates)

function removeDuplicates(string){
    //take input string and turn into array
    const stringArr = Array.from(string);
    //we need to keep track of previous char, set to null for now
    let prevChar = null;
    //an array to hold only one instance of a character that appears twice
    let newArr = [];
    //count initialized to zero, if it is > 0, we know at least one duplicate has been found
    let count = 0;
    //loop through original array from string
    for(let i = 0; i < stringArr.length; i++){
        //store current index as current char
        let currentChar = stringArr[i];
        //if current char is equal to previous, push current index into new array
        if(currentChar === prevChar){
            newArr.push(stringArr[i]);
            count += 1;
        }
        //assign currentChar as prevChar at end of loop
        prevChar = currentChar;
    }
    //figure out which array needs to be returned
    return (count >= 1 ? newArr : stringArr);
}

//2.Fizz Buzz, print numbers from 1 - 100
//For numbers that are divisible by 3, write 'Fizz' in place of number
//For numbers that are divisibible by 5, write 'Buzz' in place of number
//For numbers that are divisible by 3 AND 5, write 'FizzBuzz' in place

for(let i = 1; i <= 100; i ++){
    //check BOTH first, otherwise other condition will always be satisfied
    if(i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0){
        console.log('FizzBuzz');
    }else if(i % 3 == 0){
        console.log('Fizz');
    }else if (i % 5 == 0){
        console.log('Buzz');
    } else {
        console.log(i);
    }
}

//3.Write a function that takes in a string and returns the reversed string

function revserseString(string){
    return Array.from(string).reverse().join('');
}

//4. Print out a Triangle to the console or screen like the one below
//*
//**
//***
//****

function drawTriangle(){
    const star = '*'; 
    for(let i = 1; i <= 4; i ++){
        console.log(star.repeat(i));
    }
}
