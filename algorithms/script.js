//1. Remove Adjacent Duplicates From a String (currently only works if string is only composed of adjacent duplicates)

function removeDuplicates(string){

    const stringArr = Array.from(string);
    //we need to keep track of previous char, set to null for now
    let prevChar = null;

    //count initialized to zero, if it is > 0, we know at least one duplicate has been found
    let count = 0;
    //loop through original array from string
    for(let i = 0; i < stringArr.length; i++){
        //store current index as current char
        let currentChar = stringArr[i];
        //if current char is equal to previous, push current index into new array
        if(currentChar === prevChar){
            newArr.push(stringArr[i]);
            count += 1;
        }

        prevChar = currentChar;

    //figure out which array needs to be returned
    return (count >= 1 ? newArr : stringArr);
}

//2.Fizz Buzz, print numbers from 1 - 100
//For numbers that are divisible by 3, write 'Fizz' in place of number
//For numbers that are divisibible by 5, write 'Buzz' in place of number
//For numbers that are divisible by 3 AND 5, write 'FizzBuzz' in place

    //check BOTH first, otherwise other condition will always be satisfied
